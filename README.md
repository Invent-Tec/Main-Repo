# Main-Repo
Invent-Tec Home Repo

Made changes to the readme file. 
I have now additionally created a new branch and am making changes to the readme file. At some point I will comit this to the master, so that these changes become synchronized with the master. This is equivalent to me working on a design file or document, before commiting it as the final version. Essentially I could have multiple versions of the initial template, depending on requirements. Once final version has been approved. It can be comitted to the master repo.
